Hi there! Im Alex!
I am a Backend Software Engineer and previous Surgical Neurophysiologist. Throughout my life, I spent most of my time creating, crafting, fabricating, and tinkering. I have solved problems with my hands, my brain, and my heart - sometimes all at the same time.
I specialize as a Software Engineer with experience working on projects involving large amounts of data, API construction and consumption, and focus heavily on OOP principles.
I love working with people and companies who share the same values and mindset for growth, innovation, learning, and compassion that I do. As a professional, I aspire to bring optimism, curiosity, creativity, and grit to the workplace; working alongside a team I can learn from and a company I can grow with.
