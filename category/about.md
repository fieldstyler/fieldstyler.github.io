Hello! My name is Tyler Fields. I am a Backend Software Engineer and former High School Mathematics Teacher with a passion for people, puzzles, Ping-Pong, puppies, and *Peggy*. Some of my other major passions that don't start with the letter *p* include Tennis, Broadway shows (hence the *Peggy* reference), being goofy all of the time (hence the random alliteration in the previous sentence), basically any game (board, card, video, etc.), and hanging out with my wife and *son* who is an 11-month-old Australian Shepherd named Larry!

Throughout my life, I have always loved working with people. Helping, teaching, and collaborating with friends and colleagues are what bring me joy. Last year, though, I decided to make a major shift. I made the incredibly hard decision to end my five-year career as a Math Teacher in search of something new. Although I will always love teaching and pushing students/people to be the best they can be, I learned that I need a career that challenges me as well. The repetition of teaching high school math year after year was weighing on me, and the reason behind my struggle was that I was pushing others to be the best they could be, but my personal growth was being left behind.

As I searched for a newfound passion, one of my best friends (Math Teacher turned Software Engineer) reached out to me about a try-coding event held by the coding school she worked for. Being a mathematically minded person, but not knowing much of anything about the tech world, I thought this was a great opportunity. I drove to their Campus in downtown Denver to attend the one-day event, and that's all it took. I immediately fell in love with coding. Sure, I barely scratched the surface of what coding entailed or what I could learn, but that was exactly the point. I knew in that moment that software would never stop growing and improving. In turn, I knew that I would always have the opportunity to push myself to grow, to learn new things every year, every month, every day. Finally, I found what I was looking for.

After eight months of grueling coding projects, rapidly approaching deadlines, new technologies, new teammates, and one brand new passion, **I graduated!** from the Turing School of Software and Design with a head full of optimism and a lifetime of opportunities awaiting me. During my time at Turing, I spent the majority of the time working on projects with a strong focus on OOP principles, large amounts of data, and API construction/consumption. (Check resume for more details)

2020 was an incredibly exciting year for me. Even more important than finding a new career and passion, I found a partner to spend the rest of my life with, and a cute little dog who will go down in history as the first *other* member of the Fields family.

On June 28th, 2020, my wife, Hailey, and I got married in Morrison, CO. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 restrictions, we were only able to hitch it up at 15% capacity, but it was a gorgeous day filled with only our most favorite people in the world. To remedy the 15%, though, we're planning on having an Anniversary Party with as many of the original guest list invitees as possible (similar to the reception that we would have had without Covid-mania). We are very excited to celebrate with everyone this year as safely as possible.

Three months before the wedding we made another life-changing decision of adopting Larry. He is the love of our lives and brings us so much happiness and joy every day. Larry loves food more than anything in the world, and sometimes lets us know that we better not disturb him while he's eating (we're working on it :D). He loves to play 24/7, mostly with his favorite ball, but will enjoy the occasional frisbee, bone, or fun toys from his collection. Larry turns one on March 20th, and we plan on throwing a marvelous surprise party!

This is my wonderful life, and thank you to everyone who made it this far. Friends and family, I love you dearly. Potential employers, hire me! I'm so ready to join a new team a prove what a great asset I can be to any organization that focuses of positive relationships and mentorships, hard work, growth mindsets, and strives to hire good people. `It's coding time!`
