Sweater Weather is an application built to plan road trips. This app is an API that aggregates data from multiple external API's, takes in a location, and returns the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the given destination.

- Travel along the California coast and enjoy some In N' Out Burger while dodging potential rainy days (Not likely).
- Head from New York to Chicago, watching a baseball game in every city along the way! Don't worry, we'll make sure that you don't have to sit through any rain delays!
- Denver to London, that won't work! It's a road trip app you goofball!

There is no front-end site to this app. Check out the back-end repo below.

This project was built with: `Ruby on Rails`

Matrimania is an application designed to remove the mania of capturing memories of wedding celebrations. A vendor (wedding photographer) can organize their upcoming photoshoots, request necessary information from their clients, and access an easy-to-read carousel view of photos they must take during the special day.

Matrimania In Action: <a href="https://lnkd.in/g3CTJrA">Demo Video</a>

I worked on this project with three frontend engineers and one fellow backend engineer. That being said, I had nothing to do with how gorgeous this app looks, just the boring 'ol data! Gotta love that data!

The backend for this project was built with: `Python, Django, and Docker`
